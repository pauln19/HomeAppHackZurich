	 * * Match-Standard-and-Data: Only standard frames with matching identifier and
	 *   data bytes are received.
	 * * Match-Extended: Only extended frames with a matching identifier are received.
	 * 
	 * The mask and filters are used as bit masks. Their usage depends on the mode:
	 * 
	 * * Disabled: Mask and filters are ignored.
	 * * Accept-All: Mask and filters are ignored.
	 * * Match-Standard: Bit 0 to 10 (11 bits) of mask and filters are used to match
	 *   the 11-bit identifier of standard frames.
	 * * Match-Standard-and-Data: Bit 0 to 10 (11 bits) of mask and filters are used
	 *   to match the 11-bit identifier of standard frames. Bit 11 to 18 (8 bits) and
	 *   bit 19 to 26 (8 bits) of mask and filters are used to match the first and
	 *   second data byte (if present) of standard frames.
	 * * Match-Extended: Bit 0 to 10 (11 bits) of mask and filters are used
	 *   to match the standard 11-bit identifier part of extended frames. Bit 11 to 28
	 *   (18 bits) of mask and filters are used to match the extended 18-bit identifier
	 *   part of extended frames.
	 * 
	 * The mask and filters are applied in this way: The mask is used to select the
	 * identifier and data bits that should be compared to the corresponding filter
	 * bits. All unselected bits are automatically accepted. All selected bits have
	 * to match one of the filters to be accepted. If all bits for the selected mode
	 * are accepted then the frame is accepted and is added to the read buffer.

	 * be set to Match-Standard with 0x7FF as mask and 0x123 as filter 1 and filter 2.
	 * The mask of 0x7FF selects all 11 identifier bits for matching so that the
	 * identifier has to be exactly 0x123 to be accepted.
	 * 
	 * To accept identifier 0x123 and identifier 0x456 at the same time, just set
	 * filter 2 to 0x456 and keep mask and filter 1 unchanged.

	 * 
	 * * A write timeout occurs if a frame could not be transmitted before the

	 *   receives more frames than the Bricklet can handle. Using the read filter
	 *   (see {@link BrickletCAN#setReadFilter(short, long, long, long)}) can help to reduce the amount of received frames.
	 *   This count is not exact, but a lower bound, because the Bricklet might not
	 *   able detect all overflows if they occur in rapid succession.
	 * * A read buffer overflow occurs if the read buffer of the Bricklet is already
	 *   full when the next frame should be read from the read register of the CAN
	 *   transceiver. In this case the frame in the read register is lost. This
	 *   happens if the CAN transceiver receives more frames to be added to the read
	 *   buffer than are removed from the read buffer using the {@link BrickletCAN#readFrame()}
